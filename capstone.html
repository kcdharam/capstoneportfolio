									<h2>Stu-Share Android APP</h2>
									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<h4>(An Android App for GBC Students to Build a Digital Community)</h4>

									<p>This app is specifically for George Brown students and alumni until their email is valid. Account registrations will be verified through George Brown emails. After graduation, the GBC students have to verify their email every certain period of time (to be determined later) to make sure the email’s validity. The android app will connect GBC students who will be able to organize events, sell/buy and lend/borrow used books, and share car rides or rental residences.
										The app will not be cross-platform for now. Therefore, only android phone users can use this app.
										Moreover, the android app will not require any students’ information from GBC college database. Similarly, the end users will not be required to provide any of their personal address, car and resident information in order to use the app services.
									</p>
									<h3>Project Vision</h3>
									<p>
										The objective of the project is to develop  an android app on which students will have a digital platform for GBC students to connect with each other so that they will establish a GBC digital community where they can organize events (create, register, modify and cancel events), sell/buy or lend/borrow used books, and find a partner to share their rental residence and car rides. For now, it targets only android users.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Android application will enhance students' experience at George Brown College. 
										This application will provide means to connect with each other, share information regarding buying or selling books, finding roommates and carpooling.
										In addition, it will also help students to create or join events online.
										This android application will address five main problems of student life. 
										First one is to find a roommate, secondly find or offer a ride  to college, thirdly, buying or selling books, fourthly, creating or joining events and lastly contacting each other. Stu-Share is a great option for students because it will save time, money and resolve many challenges faced by students.Presently, George Brown Students are trying to sell the books by putting the posters on the boards or in the toilets. It is very difficult to connect with each other unless they share their personal phone numbers or email ids
									</p>
									<p>
										Therefore, the app will connect GBC students digitally, and solve these problems.
									</p>
									<h3>Project Requirements</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>
											There is currently no digital platform where students can create or join events.
										</li>
										<li>
											Similarly, there is no platform for students who are looking to buy or sell books from other students.
										</li>
										<li>
											There is no platform for students to connect with other students who will be interested in ride sharing.
										</li>
										<li>
											It is difficult to find individuals who are looking for roommates unless you know someone personally.
										</li>
										<li>
											It is difficult to directly communicate or reach another students unless you have private information like a phone number, email, or social media account information.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The Stu-Share project will provide solutions to these requirements.</p>
									<h3>Project Plan</h3>									
										<img src='images/projectplan.jpg' alt='error'>				
									
									<h3>Requirement Analysis and Design</h3>
									<h4>Software Requirement Analysis and Design</h4>
									<p>
										An android application on which students can share information. 
										To use the services of this app, students must register via their school email, login. 
										Information shared will be regarding books to lend, sell, borrow, or buy; rideshare; find roommates; create or join events; and in-app messaging. The main purpose of this application is to share information, create events and join events. This app does not deal with the monetary aspects or personal information.
									</p>
									<p>
										This app is specifically for George Brown students and alumni until their email is valid. Account registrations will be verified through George Brown emails.
										After graduation, the GBC students have to verify their email every year  to make sure the email’s validity. The android app will connect GBC students who will be able to organize events, sell/buy and lend/borrow used books, and share car rides or rental residences.The app will not be cross-platform for now. Therefore, only android phone users can use this app.
										Moreover, the android app will not require any students’ information from GBC college database. Similarly, the end users will not be required to provide any of their personal address, car and resident information in order to use the app services.

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
										<p>An app made by student and used for student</p>
									</header>
									<p>As a capstone project, Stu-share involves in a lot of practical questions and challenges.
										 From this project on, I am not thinking like a student ,but a junior programmer who is working for his clients in the real world. 
										I have to collect user requirements and convert them into project documents. I learned to stand on client side base on customer oriented 
										attitude by providing user-friendly GUI,smooth data flow via well desgined APP operation sequence.
										 I mastered detail-oriented and critical thinking skills to minimize the risk of the  project.  All in all , with the experience gained from this project, I am confident to take any related position in the industry. </p>
